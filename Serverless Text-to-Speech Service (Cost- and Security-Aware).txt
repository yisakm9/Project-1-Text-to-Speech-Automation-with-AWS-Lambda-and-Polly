 a professional project description for your AWS Lambda + Polly + S3 solution, explicitly framed as a Cost- and Security-Aware Serverless Project.



# Serverless Text-to-Speech Service (Cost- and Security-Aware)

# Overview

This project implements a serverless text-to-speech (TTS) pipeline using:

* AWS Lambda for orchestration
* Amazon Polly for speech synthesis
* Amazon S3 for storage
* API Gateway and S3 event triggers for input

The system is explicitly designed to demonstrate **COST OPTIMIZATION** and **SECURITY BEST PRACTICES**.



# Key Objectives

1. Convert text to speech at scale
2. Minimize costs through caching and resource policies
3. Implement strong security controls for data and infrastructure

#Cost Awareness Features

1. Output Caching

   * The Lambda function hashes input text and checks S3 for an existing MP3.

     * If found, re-use it (avoids additional Polly costs).

2. S3 Lifecycle Policies

   * Audio files are automatically moved to **S3 Glacier** or deleted after a retention period.

3. CloudWatch Budgets & Metrics

   * Monitors Polly usage, S3 storage, and Lambda execution times.



#Security Awareness Features

1. Least Privilege IAM Roles

   * Lambda only has:

     * polly:SynthesizeSpeech
     * s3:GetObject / s3:PutObject on specific buckets

2. Encrypted S3 Buckets

   * Both input and output buckets enforce SSE-KMS encryption
   * Public access is completely blocked

3. Protected Environment Configuration

   * Sensitive data and bucket names stored securely (not hardcoded).

4. Auditing & Logging

   * CloudTrail logs all API calls
   * CloudWatch Logs for Lambda execution



#Workflow

1. User sends text (API) or uploads a `.txt` file (S3).
2. Lambda:

   * Computes a unique hash of the text.
   * Checks S3 output bucket for an existing audio file.
   * If found → Returns cached audio.
   * If not → Calls Polly to synthesize speech and uploads MP3.
3. Files are encrypted and managed with lifecycle rules.



# Benefits

* Cost Efficient: No duplicate Polly costs, automatic archival of unused files.
* Secure by Design: Encryption, least privilege, private buckets.
* Fully Serverless: Scalable and low maintenance.



# Use Cases

* E-learning platforms
* Accessibility tools
* Voice-enabled notifications
* Automated podcast/audiobook generation
